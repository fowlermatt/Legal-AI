# Legal AI Assistant 

This project is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an AI-powered legal assistant designed to help with document-based queries. Using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, it processes legal documents and provides accurate, citable answers to user questions.

The goal is to create a system that can understand a library of legal documents and act as a knowledgeable, on-demand assistant.
